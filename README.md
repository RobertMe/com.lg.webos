This app supports webOS TVs made by LG. It can control them from the Flow Editor with the followings actions:

* Set a TV channel
* Set an Input Source (e.g. HDMI 2)
* Set volume & mute
* Power off the TV
* Show a message on the screen

_Note: Turning on the TV is currently not yet supported, this will be added later when the Infrared API is finished._

_Note: Once the TV is turned on, it takes roughly 30 or 40 seconds for the app to recognize this. Please take this into account when making the flows._
